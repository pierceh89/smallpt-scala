# Smallpt-scala

This is scala port of [smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)

It works, but optimization is ongoing.

I simply translated C++ code to scala.

After parallel stream was applied, StackOverflow exception occurs at high sample size.

This perhaps could be fixed by making radiance function as tail recursion.
